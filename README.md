# Navigation Dataset

This dataset contains how real human navigation in a $6 \times 6$ grid world, and how human infer the goals of other players.

## Navigation Bahavior

The game interface is shown below. Human partipants will use keyboard to control the player move {up, down, right, left} from a start position to a given goal position (red star). The experiment data is stored in [Experiment 1](experiment1/).

## Belief Inference

The game layout is shown below. Human partipants will see how robot move and are asked to infer which goal (gree triangle or red star) the robot is moving towards. The experiment data is stored in [Experiment 2](experiment2/) and [3](experiment3/).
